# Security Policy

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

Aria is built with **100% local/offline operation** as a core principle. Your privacy is guaranteed by design, not by policy.

### What This Means

| Aspect               | Status                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**     | All data stays on your device                  |
| **Network Requests** | None – Aria never connects to external servers |
| **Telemetry**        | ❌ None                                        |
| **Analytics**        | ❌ None                                        |
| **Tracking**         | ❌ None                                        |
| **Cloud Sync**       | ❌ None                                        |

### How It Works

- **AI Processing**: Handled entirely by [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) running on your local machine
- **Character Data**: Stored locally in your app directory
- **Conversations**: Never leave your device
- **Settings**: Saved locally, never transmitted
