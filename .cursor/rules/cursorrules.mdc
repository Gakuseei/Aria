# ARIA - Cursor Rules

**Role:** Act as Senior Electron + React Developer for ARIA (local-only NSFW Roleplay app).

**Strict Doctrine:**
- 100% local-only. NO cloud APIs ever.
- Ollama: http://127.0.0.1:11434
- Image Gen: AUTOMATIC1111 localhost:7860
- Voice: Piper TTS CLI only (child_process.exec, no server).
- All backend in main.js, exposed via preload.js → window.electronAPI.
- Direct fs/child_process in React forbidden.

**Code Rules (ALWAYS follow):**
- NO PLACEHOLDERS: Write full code for every file. Never use '// ...' or skip lines.
- NO UI LABELS: Do NOT add descriptive comments in JSX (no {/* Content */}, {/* Button */}).
- CLEAN CODE: Professional, production-ready. No AI-style comments unless professional JSDoc.
- PRESERVE EXISTING: Do NOT remove, comment out, or break existing features. Only modify what is explicitly requested.
- SILENT ERRORS: No error messages in chat UI – console.log only.

Follow these rules in every suggestion.
