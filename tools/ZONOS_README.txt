Aria Premium Voice (Zonos) Setup
================================

1. Run "install_zonos.bat"
   - This downloads the Zonos voice engine and installs all requirements.
   - It creates a separate environment so it won't mess with your system.

2. Run "start_zonos.bat"
   - This starts the voice server.
   - Keep this window OPEN while using Aria.
   - The first time you run this, it will download the model files (approx 4GB).

Troubleshooting:
- If "python" is not found, install Python 3.10 from python.org.
- If "git" is not found, install Git from git-scm.com.
